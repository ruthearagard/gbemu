Introduction
------------

As it currently stands, the main focus is to emulate the
original Game Boy (DMG-01/DMG-CPU-01/DMG-CPU) model. At a future point, Game
Boy Color (CGB-001/CGB-CPU-01/CPU CGB) support will be added.

Super Game Boy (SGB) support is a permanent non-goal.

TODOs
-----

* Graphical debugger
* Sound output
* Passing test ROMs (already pass blargg's)
